FileMesh-RS Test File
====================

This is an example file for testing the FileMesh-RS peer-to-peer file transfer application.

Features:
- Direct connections for optimal performance
- Relayed connections for NAT traversal
- Hole-punching (DCUtR) for upgrading relayed connections
- Streaming file transfer with progress tracking
- Broadcast or targeted file sending

To test:

2. Use the "send" command to transfer this file
3. Check the received_files/ directory on receiving peers

Happy testing!
